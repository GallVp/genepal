# plant-food-research-open/genepal: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline.

The directories listed below will be created in the results directory after the pipeline has finished. All paths are relative to the top-level results directory.

<!-- TODO nf-core: Write this documentation describing your workflow's output -->

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

<!-- no toc -->

- [Repeat annotation](#repeat-annotation)
- [Repeat masking](#repeat-masking)
- [RNAseq trimming, filtering and QC](#rnaseq-trimming-filtering-and-qc)

### Repeat annotation

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `repeatmodeler/`
  - `*.fa`: Repeat library
- `edta/`
  - `*.EDTA.TElib.fa`: Repeat library

</details>

A repeat library is created with either [REPEATMODELER](https://github.com/Dfam-consortium/RepeatModeler) or [EDTA](https://github.com/oushujun/EDTA). The choice of the tool is specified by the `repeat_annotator` parameter (default: `repeatmodeler`). Repeat annotation outputs are saved only if `save_annotated_te_lib` parameter is set to `true` (default: `false`).

### Repeat masking

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `repeatmasker/`
  - `*.masked`: Masked assembly
  - `*.gff`: Repeatmasker output in GFF3 format

</details>

Soft masking of the repeats is performed with [REPEATMASKER](https://github.com/rmhubley/RepeatMasker) using the repeat library prepared in the previous step. Masking outputs are saved only if `repeatmasker_save_outputs` parameter is set to `true` (default: `false`).

### RNAseq trimming, filtering and QC

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Reformatted samplesheet files used as input to the pipeline: `samplesheet.valid.csv`.
  - Parameters used by the pipeline run: `params.json`.

</details>

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
