Test data was generated by taking the first 600,000 bases of 'NC_080133.1' from [GCF_019202715.1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_019202715.1/). The annotation contains non-protein coding models and would cause the 0.5.0 version of the pipeline to fail due to its inability to handle non-protein coding models correctly.
